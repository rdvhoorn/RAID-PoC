# RAID-PoC
PoC for AUMC RAID application

## Project Goal: RAID (Routine AI in Diagnostics)
RAID integrates AI analysis tools directly into the Sectra-PACS workflow to support pathologists in diagnosing tissue images. Through a new "AI Tools" dropdown in Sectra-PACS, users can request analyses such as cell classification or tumor outlining.
These requests are sent to the separate RAID application, which handles processing asynchronously. Once complete, RAID notifies Sectra-PACS, allowing results to be displayed as overlays or in a dedicated results panel.

## ðŸ§ª Quickstart (Local HPC Testing)
When correctly setup, just use the make file to startup (`make up`). This will launch redis + FastAPI + Celery. Assuming the postgres db and configs are set up correctly, this is the only setup needed.

# Full setup
Three parts
1. Environment setup
2. PostGreSQL database initialization
3. Config file setup

## Environment setup
Assuming miniconda is installed
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate RAID-PoC
pip install uv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Postgres setup
Assuming the environment is activated
```bash
initdb -D <path/to/where/you/want/your/databasefolder>
```

## .env file
Copy paste the `example.env` file and rename to `.env`. Set the right parameters, given your install

# File structure
```bash
raid_poc/
â”œâ”€â”€ api/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.py             # API endpoint definitions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ schemas.py          # Request/response schemas

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models.py           # DB model definition
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ session.py          # DB session init

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ clear_db.py         # Clearing all db entries
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config.py           # Config loading file from .env (no need to edit)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ init_db.py          # DB initialization script
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ unit/               # All unit tests
â”œâ”€â”€ run_task.py             # Manual test input file
â”œâ”€â”€ example.env             # Contains paths like OUTPUT_DIR
â”œâ”€â”€ Makefile                # Script definitions for easier application running
```

### ðŸ”§ Notes
**Avoid** running with default concurrency (--concurrency=1 --pool=solo) to prevent session crashes due to OOM fallbacks on helios.
